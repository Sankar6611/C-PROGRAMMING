# 🎯 Learning Outcomes
Strengthened fundamentals of C programming (loops, conditions, functions, recursion, file handling).

Implemented core DSA concepts (stack, queue, linked list, trees, graphs, hashing).

Built a strong foundation for problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

# 🙏 Acknowledgements
Special thanks to my faculty, peers, and online resources that helped me learn and practice these concepts effectively.

✨ This repository showcases my progress in C Programming & DSA, and I’ll continue building more advanced projects ahead.
